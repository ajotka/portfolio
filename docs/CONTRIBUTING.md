## Setting Up the project locally

To install the project you need to have `node` and `npm` (or `yarn`)

1.  [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone
    your fork.

2.  From the root of the project: `npm` to install all dependencies

3.  from the root of the project: `npm start` to run the cli.

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. 
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.
